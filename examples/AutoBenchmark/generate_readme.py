# AutoBenchmark

This program creates instances of `ScanningModule` using different
configurations of the `LedMatrix` class:

* `direct`: group and segment pins directly connected to MCU
* `single_sw_spi`: group pins connected directly to MCU, but segment pins
  connected to 74HC595 accessed through software SPI (`SwSpiInterface`)
* `single_hw_spi`: group pins connected directly to MCU, but segment pins
  connected to 74HC595 accessed through hardware SPI (`HwSpiInterface`)
* `dual_sw_spi`: group pins and segment pins connected to 74HC595 accessed
  through software SPI (`SwSpiInterface`)
* `dual_hw_spi`: group pins and segment pins connected to 74HC595 accessed
  through hardware SPI (`HwSpiInterface`)

It measures the time taken by `ScanningModule::renderFieldNow()` which
renders a single digit (multiple fields make up a frame, a frame is the
rendering of all digits on the display module).

**Version**: AceSegment v0.4+

**DO NOT EDIT**: This file was auto-generated using `make README.md`.

## Dependencies

This program depends on the following libraries:

* [AceCommon](https://github.com/bxparks/AceCommon)
* [AceSegment](https://github.com/bxparks/AceButton)

On AVR processors, the following library is required to run the
`digitalWriteFast()` versions of the low-level drivers:

* [digitalWriteFast](https://github.com/NicksonYap/digitalWriteFast)

## How to Generate

This requires the [AUniter](https://github.com/bxparks/AUniter) script
to execute the Arduino IDE programmatically.

The `Makefile` has rules to generate the `*.txt` results file for several
microcontrollers that I usually support, but the `$ make benchmarks` command
does not work very well because the USB port of the microcontroller is a
dynamically changing parameter. I created a semi-automated way of collect the
`*.txt` files:

1. Connect the microcontroller to the serial port. I usually do this through a
USB hub with individually controlled switch.
2. Type `$ auniter ports` to determine its `/dev/ttyXXX` port number (e.g.
`/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`).
3. If the port is `USB0` or `ACM0`, type `$ make nano.txt`, etc.
4. Switch off the old microontroller.
5. Go to Step 1 and repeat for each microcontroller.

The `generate_table.awk` program reads one of `*.txt` files and prints out an
ASCII table that can be directly embedded into this README.md file. For example
the following command produces the table in the Nano section below:

```
$ ./generate_table.awk < nano.txt
```

Fortunately, we no longer need to run `generate_table.awk` for each `*.txt`
file. The process has been automated using the `generate_readme.py` script which
will be invoked by the following command:
```
$ make README.md
```

The CPU times below are given in microseconds. The "samples" column is the
number of `TimingStats::update()` calls that were made.

## CPU Time Changes

v0.4: Huge refactoring of core AceSegment classes. Rewrote AutoBenchmark
to match similar programs in the AceButton, AceCrc and AceTime libraries.

v0.5: Add benchmarks for `Tm1637Display`. The CPU time is mostly determined by
the calls to `delayMicroseconds()`, which is required to meet the electrical
characteristics of the LED module.

## Results

The following tables show the number of microseconds taken by:

* `ScanningModule::renderFieldNow()`
    * renders the 8 segments of a single LED digit. If the LED module has 4
      digits, then `renderFieldNow()` must be called 4 times to render the light
      pattern of the entire LED module. The entire rendering is then called a
      frame.
* `Tm1637Display::flush()`
    * sends all digits in the buffer to the TM1637 LED module using the I2C-like
      protocol
    * a bitDelay of 100 microseconds is used

Most people can no longer see flickering of the display at about 60 frames a
second. To achieve that, the `renderFieldNow()` method must be called 240
times a second for a module with 4 digits, or every 4.17 milliseconds. The
results below show that every processor, even the slowest AVR processor, is able
to meet this threshhold.

* For the `LedMatrixDirect` type, this involves turning off the previous digit,
  sending the 8 bits for the current digit's 8 LED segments in a loop, then
  turning on the current digit. The `digitalWrite()` function is called 10
  times.
* For the `LedMatrixSingleShiftRegister` type, the 8 LED segment bits are sent
  using software SPI or hardware SPI. (Software SPI uses the `shiftOut()`
  method, which is implemented using a loop of `digitalWrite()`.
* For the `LedMatrixDualShiftRegister` type, the LED digit pins and the LED
  segment pins are using conceptually a single SPI transaction. For software
  SPI, this is implemented using 2 `shiftOut()` operations. For hardware SPI,
  this uses a single `transfer16()` command.

On AVR processors, the "fast" options are available using the
[digitalWriteFast](https://github.com/NicksonYap/digitalWriteFast) library whose
`digitalWriteFast()` functions can be up to 50X faster if the `pin` number and
`value` parameters are compile-time constants.

The `digitalWriteFast` library is useful to create the `Tm1637DriverFast` class,
because it consumes 600-700 fewer bytes of flash memory.
