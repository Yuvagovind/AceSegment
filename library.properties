sentence=A framework for rendering seven segment LED modules using the 74HC595, TM1637, and MAX7219 controller chips.
paragraph=Hardware-dependent code is separated from the hardware-agnostic code so that high-level application features can be written against a unified and consistent API that can support different types of LED modules. Various Writer classes provide rendering of numbers, temperature, clock digits, and strings. Brightness control is available on all LED modules. Some LED modules provide brightness control on a per-digit basis.
